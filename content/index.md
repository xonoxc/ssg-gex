# Tolkien Fan Club (But Make It Chaotic)

Alright listen up — I love Tolkien like it’s oxygen.  
Not just a casual hobby. Like **if Tolkien had a dating profile it would have more matches than me**. 💀🔥

> “I am in fact a Hobbit in all but size.”

## Why I’m Obsessively Here for Tolkien

Let’s be real:

- You could spend a thousand lifetimes in the lore and still go 🧠💦  
- Kids like it, nerds love it, even your cousin who “doesn’t read” finds something to fangirl about  
- Disney *didn’t fuck it up* (yeah I said it) — Amazon still on probation though  
- It birthed a genre so big Skyrim is just noise

## Favorite Characters–Ranked Like I Care

1. Gandalf (literal daddy wizard)  
2. Bilbo (sneaky snack thief)  
3. Sam (ride or die energy)  
4. Glorfindel (souped-up elf vibes)  
5. Galadriel (don’t make eye contact)  
6. Elrond (policy guy)  
7. Thorin (angsty beard boi)  
8. Sauron (that dude stalks eyeballs)  
9. Aragorn (step aside — throne’s mine)
